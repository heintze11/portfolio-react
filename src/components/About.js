      <h2>About Levi</h2>
      <p>
        Levi spent 12 years working as a geologist in the Oil and Gas industry. Due to recent economic and political changes he decided to pursue a career change. During 2022 he started a Coding Bootcamp which finished in December of 2022. 

        Currently working for a tech company in the Oil and Gas field, he is looking to change positions with his employer to be a Software Engineer. This will give him experience to be able to switch industries in the future.

        Levi lives in Denver Colorado and is an avid outdoorsman. He enjoys mountain biking, hiking, camping, skiing, and off-roading.
